#### Lego Rock Racers Overhaul (WIP) ####

[Original Website](http://www.rockraidersunited.org/topic/4289-lego-rock-racers-overhaul-wip/)

> I'd like to make an overhaul mod for Lego Racers which changes all the themes to Rock Raiders-related ones. 
  For instance, tracks will be re-textured to the biomes seen in the LRR game, and characters will be changed to look like LRR characters.
